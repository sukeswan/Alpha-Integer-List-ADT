1. List.java: List.java is an Abstract Data Type that is composed of integers. The list acts as a bi-directional queue. There are different methods that allow the list of integers (stored in nodes) to be manipulated. There is also a cursor node that highlights a specific node. The cursor has an index which allows for iteration through the list. The cursor can be in the list or can be absent.

2. Lex.java: This file reads in two file names. The first argument is the input file and Lex.java reads in each line of the input file saving it in a string array. The array is sorted in alphabetical order using the abstract data type listed above. This alphabetical order is kept track with a list that stores the indices of the string array in the correct alphabetical order.
